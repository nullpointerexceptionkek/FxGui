"3000, Here we are, Riding the sky-3000, Painting the night with sun, You and I-3000, mirrors of light, Twin flames of fire-3000, Lit in another time and place, I knew your name-3000, I knew your face, Your love and grace-3000, Past and present now embrace, Worlds collide in inner space-3000, Unstoppable, the song we play, Burn the page for me-3000, I cannot erase the time of sleep, I cannot be loved so set me free-3000, I cannot deliver your love, Or caress your soul so-3000, Turn that page for me, I cannot embrace the touch that you give-3000, I cannot find solace in your words, I cannot deliver you your love-3000, Or caress your soul, Age to age-3000, I feel the call, Memory of future dreams-3000, You and I, riding the sky, Keeping the fire bright-3000, From another time and place, I know your name-3000, I know your face, Your touch and grace-3000, What our hearts remember stays, Forever on a song we play-3000, Burn the page for me, I cannot erase the time of sleep-3000, I cannot be loved so set me free, I cannot deliver your love-3000, Or caress your soul so, Turn that page for me-3000, I cannot embrace the touch that you give, I cannot find solice in your words-3000, I cannot deliver you your love, Or caress your soul-"
